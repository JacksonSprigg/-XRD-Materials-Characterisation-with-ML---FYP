1. 
Check available GPUs:
    show_cluster

2. 
Allocate yourself some GPUs (Change this code to reflect needs).
As a rough guideline, 
4-8 CPUs per GPU.
Memory should be 2-4 times your dataset.
Run code:
    sbatch /monfs01/projects/ys68/XRD_ML/monash_HPC_setup/run_monARCH_GPU/sh/check_gpu_and_submit_job.sh

3.
Check if you were allocated GPUs by looking for your job in slurm_outputs.
(You may have to wait ~30 seconds for the file to be created)
The terminal outputs will all be in the slurm file now.

4.
You can check on the your jobs using:
    squeue -u `whoami`
AND
    show_job <job_num>
AND
    scontrol show job <job_num>

You can cancle a job using:
    scancel <job_id>
