1. 
Check available GPUs:
    show_cluster

2. 
Allocate yourself some GPUs (Change this code to reflect needs).
As a rough guideline, 
4-8 CPUs per GPU.
Memory should be 2-4 times your dataset.
Run code:
    sbatch /monfs01/projects/ys68/XRD_ML/monash_HPC_setup/run_monARCH_GPU/sh/submit_and_tail.sh

3.
Check if you were allocated GPUs by looking for your job in slurm_outputs.
Or use command (You have to wait ~20 seconds for the file to be created):
    tail -f slurm-<jobid>.out

4.
If that looks all good then go ahead and run the job!:
    sbatch /monfs01/projects/ys68/XRD_ML/monash_HPC_setup/run_monARCH_GPU/sh/submit_job.sh
