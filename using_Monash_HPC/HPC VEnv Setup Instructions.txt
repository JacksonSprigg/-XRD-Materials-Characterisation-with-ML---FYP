1. Point to our python environment if not already.
    source /monfs01/projects/ys68/v_envs/setup_pyenv.sh
    (Might need to do "pyenv rehash"?)

2. Activate simxrd venv:
    source /monfs01/projects/ys68/v_envs/simxrd_env/bin/activate

3. Set your code interpreter (e.g. VScode) to use this venv at location (This is not a terminal command): 
    /monfs01/projects/ys68/v_envs/simxrd_env/bin/python
    (I had a bit of trouble here, you may need to update your python extensions)

4. Set the python path:
    export PYTHONPATH="/monfs01/projects/ys68/XRD_ML:$PYTHONPATH"
